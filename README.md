# üëã Hi, I'm Gerardo Saz!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a student and aspiring developer who loves tinkering with full-stack JavaScript projects. Coding started as a hobby for me, but I'm excited to turn this passion into a career someday. I'm still learning, experimenting, and growing with every line of code I write.

## üå± Current Project: [SplitQ](https://github.com/pgap22/splitq-nextjs)

**SplitQ** is a project I'm working on to solve a real problem at events by reducing waiting times during busy periods. The idea is to create a more efficient way for people to purchase items using a web app, without having to wait in long lines.

### What I'm Learning:
- **Next.js:** Trying to understand how to build scalable and responsive web apps.
- **TailwindCSS:** Experimenting with making clean and simple designs.
- **Socket.IO:** Implementing real-time features to make the app more interactive.
- **Hardware Integration:** Learning how to connect software with hardware, like Raspberry Pi or a ESP3 with a Multi-Coin Acceptor, to bring the project to life.

This project is a big learning experience for me, and I'm excited to see where it leads!

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills I'm Working On

### Frontend:
- **JavaScript / TypeScript:** Writing code for interactive user interfaces.
- **React.js / Next.js:** Building modern web applications.
- **TailwindCSS:** Styling my projects with a utility-first approach.

### Backend:
- **Node.js / Express:** Handling server-side logic.
- **Prisma / SQL / NoSQL:** Learning about databases and data management.

### Tools & Platforms:
- **Git / GitHub:** Version control to keep track of my projects.
- **IoT:** Exploring how to connect the physical world with my code.
